# Bulls-And-Cows-Game

Play Bulls and Cows! Guess the secret code as many times as you want and see if you got it correct. 
Be mindful though if you want to make it on the high score list! Guess away!

Bulls and Cows was an assignment I made for my 3005 Object Oriented Programming Class. 
The game is similar to the game Mastermind in which one will decide the amount of digits the secret code will have. 
Upon doing that, a secret code is then created and the user must guess that secret code with numbers 1-9. 
The Bulls counter represents that the number you guessed is the correct number also in the correct position.
Muchlike, the Cow counter represents how many correct guesses you have.
However, the cows counter does not represent if you have it in the correct position. 
Once the secret code is guessed, the high score for that digit as well as all other digits will be shown.
A file will be created in C:\Data that contains the HighScore file. 
This file is read and written to the program to load and save high scores.
